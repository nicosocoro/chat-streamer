Personal project to learn Rust and GStreamer

## Development

Intall Docker (or Rancher Desktop with **CE moby**).

Install `Dev Container` extension in Visual Studio Code.

Click Search bar and type `>` to `Run command` or directly `Cmd + Shift + P` (for Mac).

Run `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`.

This will prepare your local environment to run the project without needing to install Rust nor GStreamer in your machine.
